# Background
After continuously job-searching and applying without success, I realized the importance of acquiring the data analytics skills frequently listed in job postings. Through this process, not only did I learn the necessary skills, but I also gained valuable insights into which skills are most beneficial to learn next.

The data and project information comes from [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). This data consists of job postings from 2023 and contains insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### Acknowledgement of Bias
The dataset used in this analysis primarily consists of job postings that focus on data science roles. While this may introduce some bias, as the data might not fully capture the entire software engineering job market, the insights gained are still highly relevant. This is because many of the skills and trends identified in data science roles overlap with those in software engineering, reflecting broader industry demands and highlighting key areas for skill development.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying software engineering jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for software engineers?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the software engineering job market, I took advantage of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My day to day editor for writing and executing code.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- **Python, Pandas, & Seaborn:** Used to help visualize data returned from queries. 

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the software engineering job market. In particular, I focused on non-senior-level positions, as that is what I'm currently interested in. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Software Engineer Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered software engineering positions by average yearly salary and location. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    jpf.job_id,
    jpf.job_title,
    jpf.job_location,
    jpf.job_posted_date::DATE,
    company_dim.name AS company,
    jpf.salary_year_avg AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON jpf.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    jpf.job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' AND
    jpf.job_title !~* '(Senior|Lead|Principal|Manager|Director|Sr)' AND
    jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    avg_yearly_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top software engineering jobs in 2023:

- **Global Demand:** There is a significant global demand for professionals in software engineering, as evidenced by positions located in Russia, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Having 5 different countries represented in the 10 highest paying jobs suggests that international jobs can be very lucrative. 
- **Diverse Roles:** The job postings also illustrate a diversity of specialized roles within the software engineering field. Examples include "Staff Software Engineer - MLOps", focusing on machine learning operations, and "Computer Vision Engineer", emphasizing expertise in computer vision technologies. This diversity reflects the varied and specialized nature of opportunities available in the global job market.

    SELECT
        jpf.job_id,
        jpf.job_title,
        company_dim.name AS company,
        jpf.salary_year_avg AS avg_yearly_salary
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS jpf
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON jpf.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        jpf.job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' AND
        jpf.job_title !~* '(Senior|Lead|Principal|Manager|Director|Sr)' AND
        jpf.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        avg_yearly_salary DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills AS required_skill
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    avg_yearly_salary DESC;
```

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for software engineers in 2023, based on the 10 highest palying job postings:

- **Python** and **Go** are leading with a high count of 5.
- **C++** closely follows with a count of 4 and **AWS** is right behind with a count of 3.
- Other skills show lower levels of demand with only 1 or 2 listings in the top 10 requiring them. Among these are programming languages like **C#** and **Ruby**, as well as machine learning frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.
